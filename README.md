## Overview

This project is a peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging and file sharing application written in C for Windows using Winsock2. It enables multiple peers to communicate by sending text messages and transferring files by splitting them into chunks. The application uses ephemeral ports for outgoing connections.

## Features

### Text Messaging:
- Send and receive text messages between peers.
